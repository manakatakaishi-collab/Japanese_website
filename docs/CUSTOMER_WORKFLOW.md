# Customer workflow (how to request safe updates)

This website is a multi-page static site built with Next.js and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## How to ask for a change (simple)
Write your request in plain language. Examples:
- “Change the first paragraph on the home page to: …”
- “Replace the hero photo on the About page with this new image.”
- “Create a new page called ‘Testimonials’ with 3 quotes and add it to the menu.”

If you want a consistent format, use `CHANGE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## The two-step approval system (important)
The agent will never change the site immediately.

### Step 1 — Plan proposal
The agent replies with:
- what it understood,
- the plan (steps),
- the files it will change,
- any missing info it needs.

To let it proceed, reply exactly:
`APPROVE PLAN` or `GO`

### Step 2 — Review + publish
After the agent implements the change, it will:
- summarize the updates,
- tell you how to preview locally,
- ask you to open the page in your own browser and confirm it looks right,
- run checks (`npm run lint` and `npm run build`),
- then ask if it may publish.

Screenshots are not used by default.
They are used only when visual issues remain after the first update.

To publish to GitHub Pages, reply exactly:
`APPROVE PUBLISH`

## What you may be asked to provide
Depending on the request:
- The exact text you want to appear
- A new picture file + where it should appear
- A page title + short meta description (1–2 sentences)
- For a new page: sections you want and any links/buttons

## Replacing a picture (easy)
If you want to change a picture on the website:

1) Put the new picture file into the `images_to_update` folder (this folder is at the top level of the website folder).  
2) Tell the agent:
   - the file name you added
   - where it should appear (page + location), for example: “Contact page, top-right picture”

The agent will take care of the rest: rename it to the website’s standard format (page + location), place it in the right website folder, and update the page.

Notes:
- Please upload **one file per request**
- Best formats: `.png` or `.jpg`

## Quick visual check (extra safety)
For changes that affect what you see on the website (text, pictures, layout):
- First, open the updated page in your own browser and confirm the result.
- If something still looks wrong, the agent can take Playwright screenshots for debugging and comparison.

## How to preview changes locally
1) Open a terminal in the website folder.
2) Run:
   - `npm install` (first time only)
   - `npm run dev`
3) Open:
   - http://localhost:3000
4) Click through the pages you care about:
   - `/en`, `/en/about`, `/en/lessons`, `/en/booking`
   - `/ja`, `/ja/about`, `/ja/lessons`, `/ja/booking`

## How publishing works
When changes are pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions builds the static site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

If something looks wrong after publishing, tell the agent:
- what page is wrong,
- what you expected instead,
- and (if possible) a screenshot.
